    <h3>Beef</h3>
    <div>
    <p>I've never really tasted beef and I'm not very curious to try it either. The underlying is, that I am born to a Hindu family and it is considered a sin to consume the meat of cow (considered a sacred animal) in our culture. </p>
    <p>
      As far as I know, beef can be prepared in a variety of ways like patties made out of minced ground meat (which can be also used to prepare the Italian delicacy Metaballs and Spaghetti), sauteyd steak tartare, or fry. <a href="#main-heading">Back to top.</a>

      <h3>Sushi</h3>
      <div>
        <p> Sushi is essenially seasoned raw fish slices served    with steamed sticky rice and sauce. This dish   originated in Japan and has been popular among tourists ever since. Famous fish marktes like the Tsukiji market of Japan profit from the hundreds of Sushi restaurants buying fresh fish from them on a daily basis. The gaining popularity of Sushi encouraged people outside Japan to set up their own restaurants, like we did. We serve a wide range fishes from salmon to tuna at affordable prices. <a href="#main-heading">Back to top.</a>
